Many of us heard about the bill India recently published to control the geospatial information, but were you aware that a ban on unauthorized mapping already exists in Pakistan? This has put a dent in crowdsourced mapping in Pakistan but all is not lost.

Usman will describe how he is trying to create a digital humanitarian society in Pakistan by teaching OSM to the new generations of digital humanitarians. He will offer his perspective gained from 10 years of experience overcoming unique challenges, why it's important to him, and how Pakistanis can participate in the global humanitarian activities in spite of the ban.
