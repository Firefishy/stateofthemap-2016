The [OSM2VectorTiles](http://osm2vectortiles.org/) project offers free downloadable vector tiles from OpenStreetMap data ready to use by people interested in hosting custom base maps on their own infrastructure. The whole world fits on a USB stick and can be served from an ordinary web hosting and styled and enriched to make beautiful and fast maps for web and mobile applications.

After this talk you will know how to create and publish your own custom styled maps based on completely Open Source vector tiles. You will also learn how to host vector tiles yourself or use them completely offline. We are map enthusiasts who want to make OpenStreetMap accessible for everyone again.
