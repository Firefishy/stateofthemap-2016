Osmose is one of many quality assurance tools available to detect issues in OpenStreetMap data. In this workshop you will learn how to use it. We start by simply looking around on the map to locate possible issues on data. Get to grips with the list of issue categories and learn how to fix problems.

For the advanced people in the room we will go further to look at statistics, filters and the API. Let's also discuss how to improve the data analysers so we can intelligently spot new data problems.
