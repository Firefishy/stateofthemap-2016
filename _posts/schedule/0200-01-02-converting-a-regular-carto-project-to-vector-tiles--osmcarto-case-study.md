This talk explains how we in Geofabrik ported the openstreetmap-carto style from regular image tiles to vectortiles backed raster tiles. OSM-carto is a very complicated, and detailed style, and rendering raster images from a vector tile source with mapnik is not as easy as just changing the source. This talk explains those differences and how to overcome them, so you can port your regular style to vector tiles.
