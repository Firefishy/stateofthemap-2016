This session will examine best practices in editing conflicts, mechanical editing and editing tools. It comprises three parts, which each have their own video recording.

First, Ethan Nelson will show a few examples of editing disputes he has seen during his time on the Data Working group. Country extents and borders are a highly contentious issue and conflicts inevitably arise in the depiction of these. Ethan will submit practical proposals to better represent diverse global viewpoints of borders. [Part 1, Editing dispute examples, on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wL4yF-wxI9U).

Frederik Ramm will then explain why so-called "mechanical edits" - edits in which a large number of objects are changed without looking at them individually - can be detrimental to OpenStreetMap. He will outline the frequent pitfalls waiting for those who attempt mechanical edits, and explain the correct procedures for performing them. [Part 2, Mechanical edits, on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrvcVAPdaWI).

Finally, Simon Poole will review editing tools. He will give an overview of some "shoulds" and "don'ts" that both consumer and developers should consider when choosing a tool and developing one. The talk will be peppered with examples of some of the more arcane stuff you need to deal with to avoid criticism for using or writing a tool that breaks stuff.
