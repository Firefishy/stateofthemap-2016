A new Maproulette has replaced the old, and creating challenges is now easier than ever. In this workshop, we will take you behind the scenes and introduce you the art of crafting MapRoulette challenges. You will learn how to use Overpass queries to create challenges in seconds, and we will lift the veil on using the MapRoulette API and administration interface that is available to challenge administrators. You will come out of this session ready to create your own challenges to share with your local community or mappers all over the world!
