[Open Schools Kenya](www.openschoolskenya.org) is making information about education facilities easily available and useful to everyone. The project, which focuses on Kibera as a pilot site, is supported by Gates Foundation and implemented by Map Kibera. So far 350 schools have been mapped including informal, private and public schools. This has enabled parents to make informed choices, whilst the government, NGOs and donors can use the data to target funding and improve planning. 

Zacharia will discuss how the data was collected, and uploaded into OSM. From this a website was created to  give each and every school a profile page with details ranging from the population, programs offered, fees, and contact info.
