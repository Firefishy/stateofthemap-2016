In Managua, Nicaragua, over 1.5 million inhabitants are dependent on public transport but until now there had been no map of the 45 bus lines. Using free technology, crowd-funding and the power of collaboration, engaged citizens worked together to create the first complete public transportation map of any Central American capital.

Felix and Eduardo Augusto will discuss how they achieved this, produced a web app, gave away 40,000 free printed maps and generated a GTFS feed for routing. Not only will they present the final products, but by sharing the lessons learnt during surveying and creating open data in a developing country, they hope to inspire you too.
