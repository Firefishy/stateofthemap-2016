Map data is increasingly playing a critical role in a world - from smart navigation, to looking towards improved energy efficiency and reducing impact on the environment. More and more users are contributing to OpenStreetMap daily, and the platform already allows for versatile routing for pedestrians, bicycles, and cars, but critical gaps in the data prohibits us from tapping into its full navigation capability. 

In this interactive workshop, weâ€™ll look at the gaps and explore tagging schemes, editing tools, visualizations and workflows, and add turn-restriction, turn-lane and bicycle lane data to enhance the navigation potential of OpenStreetMap. At the end of the session, you will have quickly built the incredible skills to create navigation ready data in and around your community.
