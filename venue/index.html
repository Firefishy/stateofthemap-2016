          <p>The Vrije Universiteit Brussel is the offshoot of the French-speaking Université Libre de Bruxelles (ULB) that was founded in 1834 by a Brussels lawyer with Flemish origins, Pierre-Théodore Verhaegen. He wanted to establish a university that would be independent from the state and the church and where academic freedom would reign.</p>

        <h2 class='space-bottom1'>Accomodations</h2>

      <p>This year we have partnered with the Brussels Booking Desk to provide reduced hotel rates for State of the Map. And the OSM community is collecting details on <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/State_Of_The_Map_2016/Community_info">more local accommodation options on the wiki</a>.

      <p>For Brussels Booking Desk, it's simple to book through the <a href="https://secure.hotel.visitbrussels.be/extendedSearch?package=849&lang=en">dedicated reservation website</a>. They are also on hand to assist with any accommodation enquiries you may have before, during and after your stay! These pre-booked rates are limited so we ask that you book as early as possible.</p>

        <h2 class='space-bottom1'>Public transport</h2>

        <p><a href="http://www.stib-mivb.be">STIB-MIVB</a> run buses, trams and the metro service across Brussels. It is recommended that you buy your tickets before boarding (essential to travel by metro), as buying tickets after boarding will cost you more. The GO ticket vending machines are present in every metro station and the most important bus and tram stops all over Brussels.

        <p>There are 4 ticket types:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Single journey: €2.10 (or €2.50 if purchased after boarding)</li>
            <li>24hr day pass: €7.50 (includes the Bourget-Brussels Airport line)</li>
            <li>Airport line: €4.50 (or €6.00 if purchased after boarding)</li>
            <li>Train '+': €4.20 (add-on ticket for train passengers providing 24hr use of most routes)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Return tickets and 48hr/72hr tickets are also available however you will need to buy a MOBIB reloadable card at a cost of €5.00 (unloaded). Unless you intend to do a lot of travel in Brussels we do not recommend this.</p>

        <p>A reduced <a href="https://www.stib-mivb.be/noctis.html?l=en">night service</a> is also available on Friday and Saturday until 3am. </p>
